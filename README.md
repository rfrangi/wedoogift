# Wedoogift

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

Allow users to find a combination of cards allowing him to reach the desired value.

For example, an user is interested to make a 30â‚¬ purchase in the shop WedooStore with the id 5.
Our REST API will help him and find the suitable combination of cards to reach this amount.
The goal of this challenge is to create a component in which the user can type the desired amount he wants to
purchase.

A small server is provided to emulate the Wedoogift API to run your component with. (https://gitlab.com/wedoogift-jobs/challenge/-/tree/master/frontend/calculator-server)

To start it, go to calculator-server, run npm install and then npm start, the API will be listening on
port 3000.
